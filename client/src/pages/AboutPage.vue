        <h1>About Pocket Ranger</h1>
        <p>For Pocket Ranger, we looked at the existing process of researching and visiting national parks and decided
          that we wanted to improve and streamline the experience by making an app that has all the needed information
          in
          one spot and allows the user to keep up-to-date on alerts and events in selected national parks.</p>

        <h2>Concepts and Tools Used</h2>
        <p>To do this, we wanted to retrieve and display the relevant data from the National Parks Service API using
          HTML,
          CSS, and JS while utilizing the frameworks of Bootstrap, ExpressJs, and Vue. We also employ Mongoose and
          MongoDB in our backend.</p>
        <p>Our maps are powered using the HERE Maps API.</p>

              <h4>Autumn Eckley</h4>
              <p>I first discovered my passion for web development my freshman year of high school while I was enrolled
                in the Oregon Coast Technical Program. I instantly fell in love with the art and process of coding, but
                I didnâ€™t consider making it my career until 10 years later in 2023. Enrolling in the Boise Codeworks
                Fall 2024 Cohort was the best decision I could have made, and working on this application with such an
                incredible team has solidified my passion for software development. I am a bit of a work-a-holic, and
                frequently find myself with very little to no free time outside of my three jobs. When I am not
                deep-diving into government APIs, you can find me at home reading or cooking, playing board games or
                longboarding with friends, or planning my next big adventure overseas.

            <h4>Matthew Marchal</h4>
            <p>I was initially introduced to web and software development in high school, and pursued it for a couple
              years after, but took an extended break from programming for many years. CodeWorks has been a huge help on
              my journey to refamiliarize myself with the development world and the Pocket Ranger site specifically has
              been a great opportunity to collaborate with others and practice with skills and technologies we all were
              interested in working with.</p>

            <h4>Nigel Sprague</h4>
            <p>Hello, I am Nigel. Aside from learning web and software development skills, I am spending most of my time
              skateboarding, reading, or (most likely) working in filmmaking and the arts. With a passion for
              storytelling, a deep appreciation for the visual, and an ever expanding development toolset, I am excited
              to see where I can take the skills I have learned from the fall 2024 Codeworks cohort. Pocket Ranger
              allowed me to work both collaboratively and creatively on a team, gaining a better understanding of a
              project's journey from start to finish. Thank you to the Codeworks instructors, and to you for visiting
              our
              page.</p>
